Advent of Code 2022 ... at the end of 2023  ðŸ™‚

## AOC 2022 - using Delphi (Spring4D), Rust, and C++Builder.

This is an exercise in coding in as functional a way as possible, within the confines of the current languages.

It is also to explore / test / display / suggest features that would be positive additions to Delphi object pascal language in the future.

## The Plan

1. Standard Delphi

2. Refactor to use Spring4D

3. Rust

4. C++Builder
